## My Journey Through Building Fundamental Systems

This repository documents my progress through a series of projects where I'm building fundamental computer science concepts from the ground up. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how these systems work under the hood.

## Why Am I Doing This?

I believe that the best way to truly understand something is to build it yourself. By recreating these essential tools and systems, I aim to

- Solidify my understanding of core computer science principles.
- Improve my problem-solving and debugging skills.
- Gain practical experience with various programming languages and paradigms.
- Develop a portfolio of projects that demonstrate my abilities.
- Challenge myself and have fun!
